Hello, My name is Ajay Singh. I am a 1st Year Student at RIT and went to a small high school in the Twin Cities area of Minnesota. 
I like to play video games, take photos, do normal people things. 
I eat food, sometimes. I am currently studying Software Engineering at RIT and I am enjoying it so far.
